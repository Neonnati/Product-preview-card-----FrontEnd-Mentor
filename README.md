### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

I've kind of followed Kavin Powell YouTube tutorial on this one. because it was hard for me to get it by myself. I tried not to follow by a step by step copying, but still I can not say I did it by myself.



### Continued development

I need to focus on simplisity right from the begining. Starting the right way will save you so much work...
